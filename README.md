  - [👩‍💻 What to do](#user-content--what-to-do)

## 🎯 Goals
 - Implement a computer vision algorithm that is able to detect logos in the flickr-27 dataset:
 - What would you do if you had to detect a new unlabelled logo?
 - Why the solution proposed in **https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11417.pdf** is adapted to "real-world  dynamic applications"? 

## 📖 Rules

  - Dataset location: http://image.ntua.gr/iva/datasets/flickr_logos/
  - Provide a quick explanation of the proposed approach and the motivation 
  - Use Keras, Torch, or Tensorflow 
  - You can used any pre-trained model

## 👩‍💻 What to do

1. Fork the project via `github`
2. Clone your forked repository project https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-test
3. Commit and push your different modifications
4. Don't forget to explain how to run your code and/or get your results
5. Explain your choices, why you did things this way (in a file or in comments or the way you want)
